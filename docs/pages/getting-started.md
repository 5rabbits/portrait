# Compiling CSS and JavaScript
***

Portrait uses [Webpack](https://nodejs.org/en/) ~~for its build system, with convenients methods for working with the framework. It's how we compile our code, run tests, and more.~~

## Installing Webpack
To install Webpack, you must download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) which includes npm. npm stands for [node packaged modules](https://www.npmjs.com/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.

Then, from the command line:

1. Install webpack globally with ```npm install webpack -g```
2. Run ```npm install```, npm will look at the ```package.json``` file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.
